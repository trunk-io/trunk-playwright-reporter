# Trunk.io Playwright Reporter

This package exports a Playwright [custom reporter](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters#custom-reporters) for integration with  [Trunk Flaky Tests](https://trunk.io/flaky-tests).

## Features

- **Simple Integration** - Easy to add to any Playwright project
- **Trunk.io Optimized** - Designed specifically for Trunk.io workflows
- **Lightweight** - Minimal overhead, focused functionality
- **Reliable** - Handles various test scenarios and failure modes

## Installation

Install the package using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install @trunkio/trunk-reporter
```

## Configuration

### Option 1: Configuration File

Update your `playwright.config.ts` to include the reporter:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    ['list'], // Keep your preferred console reporter
    ['trunk-reporter'] // üëà Add the Trunk reporter
  ],
  // ... other config options
});
```

### Option 2: Command Line

Use the reporter directly from the command line:

```bash
npx playwright test --reporter="trunk-reporter"
```

## Why Trunk Reporter?

While Playwright includes a built-in JUnit reporter, the Trunk Reporter offers:
- **Better Trunk.io Integration** - Optimized JUnit XML file output for Trunk's reporting requirements
- **Simplified Configuration** - Easier setup and maintenance
- **Focused Functionality** - Purpose-built for Trunk workflows

## Examples

See the [test/target/](test/target/) directory for a complete example project that demonstrates how to use the Trunk Reporter in an existing Playwright testsuite.
